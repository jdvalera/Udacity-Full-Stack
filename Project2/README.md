###About

The project contains a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament. 

The game tournament uses the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated, and each plaer should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible. A configured Vagrant virtual machine along with python skeleton files are provided by Udacity.
