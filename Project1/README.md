#Movie Trailer Website

by John Valera, in fulfillment of [Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree] (https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)

###About

The project uses a server-side Python script to generate a website of movie trailers. A skeleton `fresh_tomatoes.py` was provided by Udacity. The script reads movie information from a CSV file and creates an html file from the movie information.

Features:
* Dynamically generated html page from Python
* Mobile friendly responsive webpage using Bootstrap 3
* Ability to add more movies easily with a CSV file that can be edited using Microsoft Excel

###How to run

Clone the repository directory and run `fresh_tomatoes.py`. The html page `fresh_tomatoes.html` should automatically open after running the Python script. If the html page is not opened from the script, you can view the page by opening the html file using your favorite web browser.
